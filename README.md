# Learning_Scheme
Basic programs produced from learning the basics of Scheme

Used Dr.Racket to code and compile programs in .scm files and .rkt files.

Racket are immutable files, and Scheme's being the barebones and mutable while also lacking libraries inherent to Racket.

BubbleSort.scm: Utilizes the bubble sort method to sort pre-defined lists called at the end of the program.
MakeAbsolute.scm: Took lists of and converted the numbers to their absolute value, printing them back to the user.
ManageLists.scm: First part of the program removes the first value in the list from the entire list and returns it to the user. The second part of the program replaces each first variable with the second variable in the call.
